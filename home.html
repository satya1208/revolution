<p><em>Coronavirus disease  2019&nbsp;(COVID-19) is an&nbsp;infectious disease&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&nbsp;(SARS-CoV-2).&nbsp;The disease  was first </em></p>
<p><em>identified in December 2019 in&nbsp;Wuhan, the capital of China's&nbsp;Hubei&nbsp;province,  and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing&nbsp;2019â€“20  coronavirus  pandemic.[9][10]&nbsp;Common&nbsp;symptoms&nbsp;include&nbsp;fever,&nbsp;cough,  and&nbsp;shortness of breath.Other symptoms may include  fatigue,&nbsp;muscle pain,&nbsp;diarrhoea,&nbsp;sore throat,&nbsp;loss of  smell, and&nbsp;abdominal pain.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;The&nbsp;time from exposure to  onset of symptoms&nbsp;is typically around five days but may range from two to  fourteen days.While the majority of cases result in mild</em></p>
<p><em> symptoms,  some progress to viral&nbsp;pneumonia&nbsp;and&nbsp;multi-organ  failure.As of 19 April 2020,&nbsp;more than 2.32 million  cases&nbsp;have been reported across 185 countries and  territories,&nbsp;resulting in&nbsp;more than 160,000 deaths. More than  595,000 people have recovered.</em></p>
<p><em>The virus is  primarily&nbsp;spread&nbsp;between people during close contact,[a]&nbsp;often  via&nbsp;small droplets&nbsp;produced by coughing,[b]&nbsp;sneezing, or  talking.</em></p>
<p><em>While these droplets are produced when breathing out,  they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than&nbsp;being  infectious over long distances.</em></p>
<p><em>People may also become infected  by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or  mouth.[6][16]&nbsp;The virus can survive on surfaces for </em></p>
<p><em>up to 72 hours.&nbsp;It  is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms,  although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later</em></p>
<p><em> stages of  the disease.The standard method  of&nbsp;diagnosis&nbsp;is by&nbsp;real-time reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction&nbsp;(rRT-PCR) from a&nbsp;nasopharyngeal swab.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Chest  CT&nbsp;imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is  a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, it  is not recommended for routine screening.</em></p>
<p><em>Recommended measures to  prevent infection include frequent&nbsp;hand washing,&nbsp;maintaining physical  distance from others&nbsp;(especially from those with symptoms), covering  coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow, and keeping unwashed hands  away from the face.&nbsp;The use of&nbsp;masks&nbsp;is recommended for  those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.&nbsp;Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary,  with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their  use, and others requiring their use.&nbsp;Currently, there is  no&nbsp;vaccine&nbsp;or specific&nbsp;antiviral treatment&nbsp;for  COVID-19.Management involves&nbsp;treatment of  symptoms,&nbsp;supportive care,&nbsp;isolation, and&nbsp;experimental measures.</em></p>
